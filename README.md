# RoxRemoteVehicle

## Features
  - Ability to add other vehicles to the config (best if the vehicles are scaled down in the model itself, they are not scaled down in the code)
  - Ability to toggle the RC screen effects in the config
  - Can change menu command in the config (default is '/rcveh')
  - No special abilities *yet*. We may make this script more advanced with special vehicle abilities (which can be toggled in the config - self destruct, return to controller, play sounds, etc...)
